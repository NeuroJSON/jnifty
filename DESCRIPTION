Description: JNIfTI Toolbox is a fully functional NIfTI-1/2 reader/writer that supports both
 MATLAB and GNU Octave, and is capable of reading/writing both non-compressed
 and compressed NIfTI files (.nii, .nii.gz) as well as two-part Analyze7.5/NIfTI
 files (.hdr/.img and .hdr.gz/.img.gz). 
 More importantly, this is a toolbox that converts NIfTI data to its JSON-based
 replacement, JNIfTI (.jnii for text-based and .bnii for binary-based), defined
 by the JNIfTI specification (https://github.com/NeuroJSON/jnifty). JNIfTI is a
 more flexible, human-readable and extensible file format compared to the more
 rigid and opaque NIfTI format, making the data easier to manipulate and share.
